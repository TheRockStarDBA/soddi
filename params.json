  "body": "### [StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) shares their database publicly.\r\nFor years, StackOverflow has been a great place to get your programming questions answered. Along the way, they've accumulated a ton of data - questions, answers, comments, users, votes, badges, and more. They provide all of that data in a [public XML data dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) updated a few times per year.\r\n\r\nThis application (SODDI) takes that XML data dump, and inserts it into a Microsoft SQL Server database. The result: a clean, simple, easy-to-understand database with real-world data that's fun to use for demos and learning SQL. \r\n\r\n### Licensing: Free and Open\r\nThe StackOverflow data is licensed under [Creative Commons cc-by-sa 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), which means you can freely use it, share it, and remix it as long as you attribute the work back to StackOverflow. Full details are on [the data dump's download page.](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange)\r\n\r\nThe StackOverflow Data Dump Importer is licensed under the MIT license, which means you're free to do anything with it that you like, as long as you include the original copyright disclaimer.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe primary coder today is Richie Rump (@Jorriss).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with SODDI or have a feature request?
